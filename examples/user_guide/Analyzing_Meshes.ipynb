    "Very often there will be specific regions of a set of results that are the most of interest, and in those cases it can be helpful to pull out a particular region's data for visualization in a clearer way.  The ``LineCrossSection`` and ``SurfaceCrossSection`` classes allow taking cross-sections of a mesh (or some other rasterizable object) along poly-lines drawn using the ``PolyDraw`` tool, letting you make an *x*/*z* or *x*/*z*/*t* plot from data laid out in *x*/*y*/*z* or *x*/*y*/*z*/*t* (respectively). These classes rasterize the data at a fixed resolution, and then sample the data at that resolution given the underlying polylines. The ``resolution`` may be defined in the units of the underlying coordinate system."
